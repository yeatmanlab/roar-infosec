# ROAR Accessibility Statement

At the Rapid Online Assessment of Reading (ROAR), we are committed to providing an inclusive and accessible digital experience for all users, including individuals with disabilities. Accessibility is a core consideration in the design and development of our platform, and we strive to ensure that our web application is usable by the widest possible audience.

## Our Commitment

ROAR aims to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA, and is actively working to improve the accessibility and usability of our platform through ongoing testing and development.

We are guided by the principles of:

- **Perceivability**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

- **Operability**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.

- **Understandability**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.

- **Robustness**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Current Accessibility Features

ROAR's platform includes the following accessibility features:

- Keyboard navigation support throughout the application
- Sufficient color contrast and scalable text
- Screen reader compatibility for key features
- Minimal use of time-based interactions that could disadvantage some users

## Limitations and Feedback

We recognize that accessibility is an ongoing effort and that some parts of the ROAR platform may not yet be fully accessible to all users. If you encounter any accessibility barriers or have suggestions for improvement, we encourage you to contact us.

We aim to respond to accessibility feedback within 5 business days.

## Testing and Evaluation

ROAR undergoes periodic accessibility reviews using:

- Manual testing with assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers)
- Automated tools (e.g., axe-core, Lighthouse)
- Internal QA processes that include accessibility checks

## Ongoing Improvements

Accessibility is integrated into our design and development lifecycle. We are continuously working with educators, researchers, and accessibility experts to identify barriers and implement improvements to better serve all users, including students with disabilities.
